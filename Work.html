While doing my undergraduate, I used to get involved in various extra-curricular activities through association with Red-Cross, Amnesty International, and other humanitarian organizations.
    After completion of undergraduate degree in Agricultural Science, I got opportunity to work as Instructor in Jiri Technical School at Nepal. The picture here shows the splendid view of the
place where I worked for a year before coming to US for my higher study. In U.S. I worked as Graduate Research Assistant from 2014 to 2016 and after graduation I worked as Research Assistant in same department.
While working as RA, I was actively involved in Agriculture Extension and Outreach activities. We had several workshops, seminars, field days, farm expo and many more with small farmers and ranchers.
Beside this, while residing at Nashville, TN, I worked as member of student chamber in the University and Nepalese organization.
